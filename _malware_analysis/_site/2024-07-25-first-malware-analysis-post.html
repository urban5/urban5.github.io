<p>In this post, we will analyze a sample piece of malware to understand its behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Malware analysis involves examining the code, behavior, and other attributes of a malware sample to understand its purpose and functionality.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-static-analysis">Step 1: Static Analysis</h2>
<p>Static analysis involves examining the malware without executing it. This includes checking the file type, strings, and other static properties.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-dynamic-analysis">Step 2: Dynamic Analysis</h2>
<p>Dynamic analysis involves running the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through static and dynamic analysis, we gain insights into the malwareâ€™s operations, which can help in developing mitigation strategies.</p>
