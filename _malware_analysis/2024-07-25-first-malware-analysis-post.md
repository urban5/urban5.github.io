In this post, we will analyze a sample piece of malware to understand its behavior and characteristics.

## Introduction
Malware analysis involves examining the code, behavior, and other attributes of a malware sample to understand its purpose and functionality.

## Step 1: Static Analysis
Static analysis involves examining the malware without executing it. This includes checking the file type, strings, and other static properties.

## Step 2: Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis involves running the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.

## Conclusion
Through static and dynamic analysis, we gain insights into the malware's operations, which can help in developing mitigation strategies.
